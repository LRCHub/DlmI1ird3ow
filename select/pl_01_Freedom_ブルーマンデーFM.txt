I’m not rich
I’m not a witch
I just work from 9 to 5
No need to worry
Don’t feel so sorry
I love hearing my favorite tunes
Jazz & Bossa Nova
Electronica
When I feel that
It’s good enough
I want more, I want more
I just want more
Freedom! Freedom! Freedom!
Life is full of wonderful things
Be moved! Be moved! Be moved!
Open your eyes, open your heart
The world’s so beautiful
I’m not slim
I don’t trim
I wear the clothes
Make me feel so fine
This is my story in my own glory
I love watching
My Favorite films
Action & Adventure
Love & Romantica
When I feel that
It’s good enough
I want more, I want more
I just want more
Feel good! Feel good! Feel good!
I will go out
With wonderful dreams
Be moved! Be moved! Be moved!
Open your eyes, open your heart
The world’s so beautiful
All birds are
Singing for you night & day
Oh! All of your dreams
Will come true
If you're always
True to yourself
Freedom! Freedom! Freedom!
Life is full of wonderful things
Be moved! Be moved! Be moved!
Open your eyes, open your heart
The world’s so beautiful
